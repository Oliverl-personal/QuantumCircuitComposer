# Quantum Circuit Composer (QCC)
This is a simple visualizer for quantum circuit building.

## About

The QCC is for users *interested* in learning about quantum logic but
with little to no knowledge of quantum logic. It is designed as a simple GUI
to allow the user to **explore quantum circuit model simulations**.


## Why is this project created?

Quantum computing has always been an interest of mine. However, due to the
complex nature of the subject, I never had the chance to dive into it. Until now.
My goal in creating this project is to understand the behaviour of qubits better
and hopefully come to appreciate some of the applications of quantum computing
at more than just the surface level.

## User Story
- As a user, I want to add gates to a circuit
- As a user, I want to see a list of gates on a circuit
- As a user, I want to see a list of available gates to add to a circuit
- As a user, I want to see the measurement/output of the circuit
- As a user, I want to have the option to save my circuit to file
- As a user, I want to have the option to load my circuit from file. However, loading a circuit will override the current circuit
